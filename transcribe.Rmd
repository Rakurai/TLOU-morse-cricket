    ## note: for some files, there seems to be a few 
  ## few beep durs that are only 1; for now, hard coding these out:
  beep.durs = beep.durs[beep.durs>10]

  ## recoding beep durs 
 
  ## note: this step needs to  take the beep.durs data and the pause.durs data
  ## and return duration barriers.  

  ## similar exercise for beep.durs:
#  raw.tab = table(beep.durs)
#  beep.centers.raw = kmeans(as.numeric(names(raw.tab[raw.tab > 5])),2)$centers[,1]
#  beep.centers = beep.centers.raw[order(beep.centers.raw,decreasing = F)]
#  beep.levels = as.vector(beep.centers)
 
#  beep.sep = mean(beep.levels[1:2])
  beep.sep = 100

beep.durs
#beep.levels
#beep.sep
#beep.durs.let
 
  # recoding beep durations to long and short:
  beep.durs.let = beep.durs
  beep.durs.let[beep.durs > beep.sep] = "-"
  beep.durs.let[beep.durs < beep.sep] = "."

  plot(beep.durs)
  write(paste(unlist(beep.durs.let), collapse = ""), paste(infile, ".txt", sep = ""))
``` 
 
```{r}
# figure out pauses, if any

  # converting indices to durations:
  pause.durs = beep.start.vals[-1] - beep.stop.vals[-length(beep.stop.vals)]

  ## note: for some files, there seems to be a few 
  ## few beep durs that are only 1; for now, hard coding these out:
  pause.durs = pause.durs[pause.durs>1]

  ## first, creating pause barriers:
  raw.tab = table(pause.durs)

  pause.centers.raw = kmeans(as.numeric(names(raw.tab[raw.tab > 5])),3)$centers[,1]
 
  pause.centers = pause.centers.raw[order(pause.centers.raw,decreasing = F)]
  pause.levels = as.vector(pause.centers)

  # determining separator values:
  pause.sep.1 = mean(pause.levels[1:2])
  pause.sep.2 = mean(pause.levels[2:3])
```
 
```{r}
  ## creating the letter and word end vectors:
  letter.ends = which(pause.durs > pause.sep.1)
  word.ends = which(as.numeric(pause.durs[pause.durs > pause.sep.1] > pause.sep.2) == 1)

    ## grouping the beep duration letters (l's and s's) into letters
  ## based on the letter ends vector
  empty.list = list()
  start.val = 1
  for(i in 1:length(letter.ends)){
    cur.points = beep.durs.let[start.val:letter.ends[i]]
    empty.list[[i]] = paste(cur.points,collapse = "")
    start.val = letter.ends[i] + 1  
  }
 
  letter.vec = unlist(lapply(empty.list, function(x){ref.df$letter[which(ref.df$code == x)]}))
 
 
  ## grouping letters into words based on word.ends vec:
  start.val = 1
  empty.list = list()
  for(i in 1:length(word.ends)){
    cur.points = letter.vec[start.val:word.ends[i]]
    empty.list[[i]] = paste(cur.points,collapse = "")
    start.val = word.ends[i] + 1  
  }
 
 
  ## saving as a new vector, with spacing:
  out = paste(unlist(empty.list),collapse = " ")
  out

## loading reference files
 
## note: you'll need to change the file path for the sf.1 file
 
## sound file can be downloaded here:
## http://www.arrl.org/files/file/Morse/Archive/10%20WPM/140625_10WPM.mp3
 
## note: you'll need to convert the file to .wav for the function to work.
