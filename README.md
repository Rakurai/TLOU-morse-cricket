# morse-transcriber
A simple transcriber in R from audio file (.wav) to Morse code dits and dahs in a text file.  Created to decode a possible Morse code easter egg embedded in the video game The Last of Us.

This code was pulled almost entirely from Mark Patterson's work on a Morse translator.  I only modified a few things to work reliably with these particular audio recordings.  The original work is here:
